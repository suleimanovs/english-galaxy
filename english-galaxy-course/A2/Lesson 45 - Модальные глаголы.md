I can help you
He can do it instead of you
I can't say it right now
I can't believe my eyes
I can't believe my ears

Can you help me?
What can we do in this situation?
I could do it it all day
We could do it right now
Could you help me, please? 
I must do it
I feel that I must get rid of these unnecessary mistakes
She must be very tired 
He must be very smart if he can understand it so quickly 
He has to wear a school uniform
He may come to the party tomorrow
It might happen 

I think you should do it 
I think you shouldn't do it
