They made a very interesting offer and i couldn't refuse
We had already left by the time she appeared
This problem wasn't solved 
He denied all the accusations
I will join you with great pleasure
I have always been interested in it
It has never interested me
It always interested me when i was a child
This event influenced me greatly 
She always helped me when i was in trouble
