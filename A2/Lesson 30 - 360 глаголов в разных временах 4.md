I asked her not to do it
Smoking isn't allowed here

I had to study really hard to pass that test
Time was passing very quickly

I have just subscribed to this channel
As we know,  native speakers usually speak very fast 

I was carrying a very heavy bag

It is said that this work will be completed next month

I suppose that it is the best price now
She discovered that someone had stolen her bag

I'm afraid i will have to redo everything
I advised her no to do it
Don't forget to save these files 

He doesn't recommend going to that place

I trust you completely
I haven't prepared for this exam yet
No one approved of this decision 

I have had so many important tasks this week

It spoilt our plans 

I have just saved the latest changes

While they are having a rest, i will be working 
I prefer not to think about it
You need to check everythinh
