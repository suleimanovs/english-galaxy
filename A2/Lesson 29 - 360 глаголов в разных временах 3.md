I have been learning English for about two years
My friend and I have been discussing this problem for about an hour

It is not easy to adapt to these conditions 
I know that we need to adapt to these circumstances

I saw him recently
I have seen him recently - и так и так верно

Are you joking? 
Are you kidding? 

I would like to congratulate you on passing the exam
It can cause serious problems in the future

He hasn't seen her lately
He said that he had always wanted to do something useful for other people

The thieves were caught and sent to prison
I decided not to do it anymore

Did you answer this letter? 
Did he reply to your letter?

I suggest going to the park now
I dont think that it will bring him real happiness

They hugged each other in the end 
How long has he been teaching English?

It seems impossible now
Their new album will be released soon

It
