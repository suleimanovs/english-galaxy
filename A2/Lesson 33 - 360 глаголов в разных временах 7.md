I have never understood it
He isn often criticized for it
He was flying home to visit his family
I need to study much harder to get rid of these mistakes
The fire was still burning
I hope to see you soon
While she was explaining a new topic no one could understand it
I feel more confident when I speak English
If you want more progress you need to practice every day
The audience was really impressed
The students were standing there waiting for their results
He is treated very unfairly
It surprises me that you have never heard about it
It strikes me that no one pays attention to it
He usually avoids talking about it
The fire is burning
When i called him he was cooking
I was standing there waiting for my results
I applied for a job
We were having an English class when the bell rang
Does it really matter?

His hospitality really impressed me
