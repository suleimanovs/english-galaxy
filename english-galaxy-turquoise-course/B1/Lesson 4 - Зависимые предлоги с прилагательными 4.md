It will depend on him
How did you answer it?
How did you answer this question?
Did she reply to your letter?
Can you explain it to me?
I can explain this thing to you
He arrived <u>at</u> the conference an hour later
It influenced me a lot
It influenced my life greatly

These events influenced my decision 
He devotes too <u>much</u> time to this hobby
What is he looking for?
How did she react to your words? 

He arrived in the end
She mentioned it in the beginning
He arrived at the end of the party
She mentioned it at the beginning of the lecture 

I firmly believe that hard work can lead us to success 
I had to adapt to those conditions 
I have already adapted to these conditions

What does it depend on?
What will it depend on?
What music do you listen to ?
What kind of music do you listen to?
